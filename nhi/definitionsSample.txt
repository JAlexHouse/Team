a connected undirected graph with no simple circuits
the property that each of their connected component is a tree
an undirected graph is a tree if and only if there is a unique simple path between any two of its vertices
a vertex of a tree
a tree in which one vertex has been designated as the rot and every edge is directed away from the root.
If v is a vertex in T other than the root, the parent of v is the unique vertex u such that there is a directed edge from u to v.
Vertices are u and v. When u is the parent of v, v is called a child of u.
Vertices with the same parent are called siblings.
The ancestors of a vertex other than the root are the vertices in the path from the root to this vertex.
The descendants of a vertex v are those vertices that have v as an ancestor.
A vertex of a rooted tree if it has no children.
Vertices that have children.
When every internal vertex has no more than m children.
When every internal vertex has exactly m children.
a rooted tree where the children of each internal vertex are ordered
if an internal vertex has two children
first child of a binary tree
second child of a binary tree
tree rooted at the left child
tree rooted at the right child
a tree with n vertices has n-1 edges
a full m-ary tree with i internal vertices contains n = mi + 1 vertices
A full m-ary tree with (i ) n vertices has i = (n − 1)/m internal vertices and l = [(m − 1)n + 1]/m leaves, (ii ) i internal vertices has n = mi + 1 vertices and l = (m − 1)i + 1 leaves, (iii ) l leaves has n = (ml − 1)/(m − 1) vertices and i = (l − 1)/(m − 1) internal vertices.
a rooted m-ary tree of height h is balanced if all leaves are at levels h or h - 1
there are at most mh leaves in a m-ary tree of height h
